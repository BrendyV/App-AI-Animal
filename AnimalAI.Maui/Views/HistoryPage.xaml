            Text="The concept of a zoo, or a place where animals are displayed and kept for public entertainment, dates back to ancient civilizations. 
                The first recorded zoological garden was established in ancient Egypt around 3500 BCE, where exotic animals were kept for the amusement of 
                the pharaoh and his guests.
                The Romans also kept exotic animals in their gardens and circuses, and the first modern zoo, the London Zoo, was founded in 1828. Since 
                then, zoos have been a popular attraction in many cities around the world.
                However, the role of zoos has evolved over time. In the past, zoos were primarily focused on displaying animals for entertainment 
                purposes and often kept animals in cramped and unnatural conditions. Today, many zoos have a strong focus on conservation and education, 
                and work to provide a more natural habitat for the animals in their care.
                Some zoos also engage in research and play a critical role in protecting endangered species and working to preserve biodiversity. 
                Despite these efforts, zoos remain a controversial topic, with some critics arguing that they are inhumane and do not adequately replicate 
                the animals' natural habitats."
